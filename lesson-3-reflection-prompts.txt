When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

  When I'm working on different computers (for example, my home and working comp.) 
  or there are several contributors makes changes on my project, remote repository
  using preferred.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  The cause is the same as for manual commiting: both commiting and pulling must
  reflect specifical logical changes in repository. Futhermore, maybe I'm not
  needed to pull EACH commit one at time. It seems more suitable to do larger piece
  of work on remote, and then pull whole of commits to local computer if needed.
