What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    When I initialized a repository, the hidden directory .git appears there.
    I have to do this to tie files and their history in repository.
    
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
    The staging area may not contain ALL files from working directory. If Add command
    was not issued, then working directory may contain files, while staging area is not.
    The files are placing in staging area BEFORE being added to repository. The staging 
    area is like a intermediate buffer between working directory and repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
